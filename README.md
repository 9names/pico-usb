# WIP: USB support for RP2040

The goal of this crate is to implement a USB driver for the RP2040 in Rust,
which can be used together with [usb-device](https://crates.io/crates/usb-device).

# Current status

Initial port of the USB low level example from the 
[pico-examples](https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-examples/tree/master/usb/device/dev_lowlevel) is done, but not functional yet.
